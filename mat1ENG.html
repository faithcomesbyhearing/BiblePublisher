      <span id="MAT1-1" class="topf" caller="*" onclick="bibleShowNoteClick('MAT1-1');"> ☞ <span class="f" style="display:none">[1:1–2:23] The infancy narrative forms the prologue of the gospel. Consisting of a genealogy and five stories, it presents the coming of Jesus as the climax of Israel’s history, and the events of his conception, birth, and early childhood as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The genealogy is probably traditional material that Matthew edited. In its first two sections (Mt 1:2–11) it was drawn from Ru 4:18–22; 1 Chr 1–3. Except for Jechoniah, Shealtiel, and Zerubbabel, none of the names in the third section (Mt 1:12–16) is found in any Old Testament genealogy. While the genealogy shows the continuity of God’s providential plan from Abraham on, discontinuity is also present. The women Tamar (Mt 1:3), Rahab and Ruth (Mt 1:5), and the wife of Uriah, Bathsheba (Mt 1:6), bore their sons through unions that were in varying degrees strange and unexpected. These “irregularities”culminate in the supreme “irregularity”of the Messiah’s birth of a virgin mother; the age of fulfillment is inaugurated by a creative act of God. </span><span class="fp" closed="false" style="display:none">Drawing upon both biblical tradition and Jewish stories, Matthew portrays Jesus as reliving the Exodus experience of Israel and the persecutions of Moses. His rejection by his own people and his passion are foreshadowed by the troubled reaction of “all Jerusalem”to the question of the magi who are seeking the “newborn king of the Jews”(Mt 2:2–3), and by Herod’s attempt to have him killed. The magi who do him homage prefigure the Gentiles who will accept the preaching of the gospel. The infancy narrative proclaims who Jesus is, the savior of his people from their sins (Mt 1:21), Emmanuel in whom “God is with us”(Mt 1:23), and the Son of God (Mt 2:15).</span></span> <span id="MAT1-2" class="topx" caller="a" onclick="bibleShowNoteClick('MAT1-2');"> ☛ <span class="x" style="display:none">a.

In the second section of the genealogy (Mt 1:6b–11), three kings of Judah, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, have been omitted (see 1 Chr 3:11–12), so that there are fourteen generations in that section. Yet the third (Mt 1:12–16) apparently has only thirteen. Since Matthew here emphasizes that each section has fourteen, it is unlikely that the thirteen of the last was due to his oversight. Some scholars suggest that </span><span class="bd" style="display:none">Jesus who is called the Messiah</span><span class="f" style="display:none"> (Mt 1:16b) doubles the final member of the chain: </span><span class="bd" style="display:none">Jesus</span><span class="f" style="display:none">, born within the family of David, opens up the new age as </span><span class="bd" style="display:none">Messiah</span><span class="f" style="display:none">, so that in fact there are fourteen generations in the third section.

The virginal conception of Jesus is the work of the Spirit of God. Joseph’s decision to divorce Mary is overcome by the heavenly command that he take her into his home and accept the child as his own. The natural genealogical line is broken but the promises to David are fulfilled; through Joseph’s adoption the child belongs to the family of David. Matthew sees the virginal conception as the fulfillment of Is 7:14.</span></span> Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.
